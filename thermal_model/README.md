# Motivation
This is a project designed to combine my practical
knowledge in mechanical engineering, with the software engineering 
experience I've gathered so far and continue to learn about
I don't think I've learned any new things in mech-e theory in a while
as my focus has been heavily in the swe side. However, I should
remind myself that I have amassed a wealth of practical production
and design skills with 3D printing and CAD, and that I've read a handful of
journals/publications in this space as well 

Now I have a great opportunity and more accurately a necessity to 
combine these skillsets and build something really cool alhamdulillah, I could have
been doing this all along, and it may have accelerated my growth, as it
did when I started working on simulations back when covid first hit.
However, as my favorite saying goes, the best time is now.

### Mechanical Theory Topics
- Thermal and material properties
- Vector Dynamics and motion
- System Dynamics, oscillatioms, damping, harmonics
- Stress/Strain material stress
- Heat transfer and phase change

### Software Development Topics
- Object-Oriented Class Structure
-- Classes, Libraries, Modules, Methods
- Collaborative development via git
- Optimized Algorithm Complexity
- Passing data across multiple layers
-- Application Layer, Framework Layer, Memory Layer
- Unit Testing and Integration Testing

Let's start with something really simple, like boiling water, which is actually
a complex phenomenon
